## Isometric Strings

- Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if `s` is isomorphic to `t`.
- String `s` is isomorphic to `t` if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.
- All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
- No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

###### For example:

- [x] Given "egg", "add", return `true`.
- [ ] Given "foo", "bar", return `false`.
- [x] Given "paper", "title", return `true`.

###### Note:

You may assume both `s` and `t` are lower case and have the same length.

###### Solution:

This is an O(n) [algorithm] (https://ideone.com/4odPij) or better.
