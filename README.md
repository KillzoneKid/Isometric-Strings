## Isometric Strings

- Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if `s` is isomorphic to `t`.
- String `s` is isomorphic to `t` if the letters in `s` can be remapped to get `t`.
- Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it in `s` with another letter.
- A letter in `s` could only be mapped to one letter in `t`.
- The ordering of the letters must remain unchanged.


###### For example:

- [x] Given "egg", "add", return `true`.
- [ ] Given "foo", "bar", return `false`.
- [x] Given "paper", "title", return `true`.

###### Note:

You may assume both `s` and `t` are lower case and have the same length.

###### Solution:

This is an O(n) [algorithm](https://ideone.com/4odPij) or better.
